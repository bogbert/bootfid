Required tools:
  . the "AwardMod BIOS Manipulation Tool" by Josef Hill
  . the "Award BIOS Editor" by Mike Tedder
  . nasm
  . bash (or another Bourne shell)
  . a C compiler to compile patch_for_injection.c

1. Extract the modules of the original BIOS file to a directory using the "AwardMod BIOS Manipulation Tool"
   One of the extracted modules is called cav_shdw.bin
2. Copy the cav_shdw.bin module to the current directory (i.e. the bootfid source directory)
3. Compile patch_for_injection.c
4. Edit the build_cav_with_bootfid.sh script, to change (if needed) some variables like the multiplier,
   the confirmation threshold, ...
5. Run build_cav_with_bootfid.sh, a file named cav_shdw_bf_<vers>_<mult>.bin is created
6. Copy and rename this file to the "AwardMod BIOS Manipulation Tool" extraction directory to replace the
   original module
7. Use the "AwardMod BIOS Manipulation Tool" to rebuild a BIOS file
8. Open the BIOS file with the "Award BIOS Editor"
   In "Recognized Item/System BIOS/BIOS ID", edit the Version information and recalc the checksum
   Then save
   You may want to close and restart the "AwardMod BIOS Manipulation Tool", and open the BIOS again to
   verify that the BIOS has not been corrupted when it was saved (this happened to me once)
9. The BIOS is ready to be flashed
